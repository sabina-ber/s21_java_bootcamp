# Chapter III
### Exercise 00 – Packages

Exercise 00: Packages ||
---|---
Turn-in directory	| ex00
Files to turn-in	| ImagesToChar-folder (exclude target)

Code can be organized on different levels. Packages are one of the code organization methods where classes are located in individual folders. 

Now your task is to implement functionality that prints a two-colored image in the console. 

An example of a black-and-white BMP image (this format is mandatory for the solution). Image size is 16*16 pixels.

![it](misc/images/it_black.png)

You can download this image [here](https://yadi.sk/i/nt-C_kZKWrlyNQ ).

Your application shall accept input parameters corresponding to characters that should be displayed in place of white and black pixels. Another main function startup parameter is the full path to the image on your disk.

If "." character is used for white color and "0" for black, the image in the console may look as follows:


![it_console](misc/images/it_console.png)

Application logic must be distributed between different packages and have the following structure:

- ImagesToChar - project folder
  - src - source files
    -	java - files of Java source code
        - edu.school21.printer - a series of main packages
          -	app - a package that contains classes for startup 
          -	logic - a package that contains the logic for converting an image into an array of characters
  -	target - compiled .class files
    -	edu.school21.printer ...
  -	README.txt
  
README.txt file must contain instructions for compiling and starting your source code from the console (non-IDE). Instruction is written for the state where the console is opened in the project's root folder.

# Chapter IV
### Exercise 01 – First JAR

Exercise 01: First JAR ||
---|---
Turn-in directory	| ex01
Files to turn-in	| ImagesToChar-folder (exclude target)

Now you need to create a distribution package of the application—a JAR archive. It is important that the image be contained in that archive (a command-line parameter for the full path to the file is not required in this task).

The following project structure shall be adhered to:

- ImagesToChar - project folder
  - src - source files
    - java - files of Java source code
      - ...
    -	resources - a folder with resource files
         - image.bmp - the displayed image
    - manifest.txt - a file containing the description of the initial point for archive startup  
  - target - compiled .class files and archive
    - edu.school21.printer ...
    - resources
    - images-to-chars-printer.jar
  - README.txt

Archive and all compiled files shall be put in target folder during assembly (without a manual file transfer; you may apply cp command to the resource folder).

README.txt file should also contain information on the archive assembly and startup.

# Chapter V
### Exercise 02 – JCommander & JCDP
Exercise 02: JCommander & JCDP ||
---|---
Turn-in directory	| ex02
Files to turn-in |	ImagesToChar (exclude lib and target)

Now you should use external libraries:
- JCommander for the command line. 
- JCDP or JColor for using colored output

Archives with these libraries shall be downloaded and included in the previous task's project. 

Now application startup parameters shall be processed with JCommander tools. The image should be displayed using the "colored" output option of JCDP library.

Required project structure:
- ImagesToChar - project folder
  -	lib - external library folder
    -	jcommander-*.**.jar
    -	JCDP-*.*.*.jar/JCOLOR-*.*.*.jar
  -	src - source files
  -	target - compiled .class files and archive
    -	edu.school21.printer
    -	com/beust ... - .class files of JCommander library
    -	com/diogonunes ... - .class files of JCDP library
    -	resources
    -	images-to-chars-printer.jar
  -	README.txt

README.txt file shall also contain the information about including external libraries in the final assembly.

Example of program operation:

`$ java -jar images-to-chars-printer.jar --white=RED --black=GREEN`

![it_red](misc/images/it_red.png)
